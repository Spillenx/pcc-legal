  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: January 8, 2026</p>

  <p>Pocket Currency Converter ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
  <p>The App stores your data using Apple technologies:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local storage</strong> on your device via SwiftData.</li>
      <li><strong>iCloud (CloudKit)</strong> synchronization if enabled in your device settings and within the App. Your data may be synced across your Apple devices using your Apple ID and stored in your private iCloud database. We do not operate our own servers for user data.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App Data</strong>: Content you create or manage is stored locally and, if iCloud sync is enabled, in your private iCloud (CloudKit) storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Permissions</strong> (if used): If the App requests access to device features (e.g., camera, microphone, photos, location), we only access them with your permission and solely to provide the relevant feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: We do not collect personal analytics by default. Aggregated diagnostics may be provided to Apple if you’ve opted in at the system level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Information is used solely to operate App features on your device and to synchronize your data to iCloud if you choose to enable iCloud. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties. iCloud (CloudKit) is provided by Apple; your synced data is associated with your Apple ID and governed by Apple’s terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data is retained on your device and, if enabled, in your iCloud account for as long as you keep it. You can delete data within the App, disable iCloud sync, and/or uninstall the App to remove local data.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage permissions and iCloud settings in your device Settings at any time.</li>
    <li>Delete data within the App (where supported), disable iCloud sync, or uninstall the App to remove local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Data stored locally benefits from device-level protections (e.g., passcode, Face ID/Touch ID). iCloud data is protected by Apple’s security measures. Please keep your device secure.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new "Last updated" date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
